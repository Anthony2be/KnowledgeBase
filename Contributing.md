# How to contribute
## Requirements
- A GitHub account
- Some basic knowledge on GitHub
- The "`GitHub Contributor`" role (Ask a Mod++ or above for it)

## Steps
Follow them in order from top to bottom
- Choose an unclaimed FAQ to re-create from `#dp-faqs`,`#rp-faqs` or `#other-faqs` (It's unclaimed if there's no `:this:` reaction)
- React to the original message with `:this:` (A custom emote on the discord) to claim it
- Do your best to re-create the message, specifically the formatting
- Create a Pull Request
- Depending on the FAQ you chose, continue by following one of the two next lists of instructions
***
### If your chosen FAQ needs a Downloadable Template
- Create the following file structure
> 📁`faq` (This folder already exists)
> > 📁`[your-faq]` (The name of your FAQ, don't include the brackets)
> > > 📄`raw-paste.txt`
> > > 🤐`example-pack.zip`
- Copy and Paste your recreation into `raw-paste.txt`
- Add the following watermarks to the bottom
```
(Copy and Paste Extract from Knowledge Base: <https://discord.gg/xpNJdH9>)
(Raw Paste & Downloadable Template: <https://github.com/SheepCommander/KnowledgeBase/tree/main/faq/[faq]>)
```
- Replace `[faq]` in the link with what you used for `[your-faq]`
- For the `example-pack.zip` use `base-datapack` as the base for `example-pack.zip`
